Augmented Reality (AR) allows devices to display digital objects within the camera view. The AR engine (ARCore) tracks images on a flat surface, then displays the 3D model attached to the image. The phone then tracks the relative location of the 3D model in your physical environment. All of the models continue to be displayed within the environment as you move around. The models can then be removed from the view and the experience can begin again.
